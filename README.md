# Numerical Methods Matlab Algorithms

These matlab functions use common numerical estimation and problem solving techniques. The techniques the algorithms use are relatively simple, but showcase the usefulnes of matlab for such computations and demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques themselves. 

Although my scripts are not currently being employed in engineering/problem solving scenarios, they mimic and serve as an excercise in algorithm development. I imagine these scripts can be throughout my time in engineering school on various projects and assignments.

The algorithms coorespond to the curriculum of the Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving class at Colorado State University.

## Use of Scripts

These functions use matlab. For install the .m scripts must be in the currently used matlab directory. They should operate as any other matlab built in function would as long as you have them in the selected matlab folder path. You will want to save the the various funtion outputs as names that make sense for use while in matlab. Of course this must be done using matlab correct syntax. For example entering the command ```[xa,ya,i]=functionname(x,y)``` will use inputs **x y** to compute and save variables **xa ya** and **i**. This is simply proper use of matlab.

More detailed and specific instructions will be located in the functions readme file found within its folder on github.
